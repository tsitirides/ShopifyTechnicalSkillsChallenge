# Summer 2021 Developer Intern Challenge for Shopify

This project allows the uploading and choosing of photos.

## DISCLAIMER: I first want to apologize for such little work, this was done in about 2 hours as I just heard about this today and wanted the oppurtunity to apply.

## Running the application locally

1. Clone this repo
2. Be sure to have FLASK and Flask_sqlalchemy INSTALLED!!
3. Run the program with flask
```
flask run
```
4. Navigate to local host, open the folder within the local host chose the index.html file (http://127.0.0.1:5000/ default)
5. Enjoy the program!


## What could be added?
Like I previously said, this app was very rushed as I had just found out about this the day it was due (May 9th 2021) but I have plenty of ideas.

## Shop System
### Adding Prices to Photos
When the user selects the photo to add, they will be prompted with a pop up that will allow them to add prices to each new photo they post. Would then be saved within the DB.
### Checkout system:
This could be implemented fairly easily with use of DB and python, adding to cart, checking out and security checks along the way would make for a great website.
### Account types:
Something I have a lot of experience with is account types, whether you are an admin, moderator or customer, access and features may be limited/extended depending on the type of account that you have


# Thank you for checking out my application!
